# Community Discussions

Welcome to the Luminous Dynamics community discussions! This is where we connect, collaborate, and build consciousness-first technology together.

## Where We Discuss

All community discussions happen on **GitHub Discussions** - a threaded forum built into our GitHub organization.

**[Join the Discussions →](https://github.com/orgs/Luminous-Dynamics/discussions)**

## Why GitHub Discussions?

We chose GitHub Discussions because it aligns with our values:

- ✅ **Open and searchable** - Anyone can read, search helps others find answers
- ✅ **Threaded conversations** - Easy to follow and participate in
- ✅ **Integrated with development** - Link to code, issues, and PRs
- ✅ **Markdown support** - Rich formatting for clear communication
- ✅ **No algorithm manipulation** - Chronological and topic-based, not engagement-optimized
- ✅ **Ownership** - We control our data and format
