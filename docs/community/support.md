### Can I pay for faster support?

Yes! Enterprise support with SLAs is available. Contact: enterprise@luminousdynamics.org

### Do you offer phone support?

Not currently for individual users. Enterprise customers can arrange phone/video support.

### What languages do you support?

Currently English only for direct support. Community members may help in other languages via Discord.

### Can you help me with general NixOS questions unrelated to Luminous Nix?

We focus on Luminous Nix support, but the community often helps with broader NixOS questions. For general NixOS help, try:

- [NixOS Discourse](https://discourse.nixos.org/)
- [NixOS Matrix chat](https://matrix.to/#/#community:nixos.org)
- [r/NixOS on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NixOS/)

### I sent an email but haven't heard back

Check your spam folder first. If it's been >3 business days, send a follow-up or ping us in Discord.

### Can maintainers help via DM/email for personal projects?

Please use public channels (Discord, Discussions) rather than DMing maintainers. This:

- Helps others who have similar questions
- Gets you faster answers (more people can help)
- Builds community knowledge base
- Respects maintainers' time

We reserve DMs for private issues (security, personal info, etc.).
