## 🌍 Community Values

### Consciousness-First
We build technology that serves human flourishing, not attention extraction.

### Beginner-Friendly
Everyone was a beginner once. We welcome all skill levels with patience and support.

### Transparency
We communicate openly about decisions, challenges, and progress.

### Diversity
We value diverse perspectives and experiences. Technology is better when everyone can contribute.

### Kindness
We treat each other with respect and compassion. See our [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).

### Sustainability
We build for the long term, not just quick wins. This includes supporting maintainer wellbeing.

## 🤝 Community Agreements

We all agree to:

1. **Follow the [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md)**
2. **Assume good intent** while being open to impact
3. **Search before asking** to respect everyone's time
4. **Share knowledge generously** without gatekeeping
5. **Give credit** to others' ideas and contributions
6. **Disagree respectfully** and focus on ideas, not people
7. **Support maintainer sustainability** (time, money, energy)

## 💬 Communication Guidelines

### Asking Good Questions

**Good questions:**
- Include context (what you're trying to do)
- Show what you've tried
- Include error messages/logs
- Are in the right channel

**Example:**
> I'm trying to install Firefox using Luminous Nix on NixOS 23.11. I ran `ask-nix "install firefox"` but got error XYZ. I've checked the FAQ and searched Discord but didn't find this specific error. Full error log: [paste]

### Giving Good Answers

**Good answers:**
- Are patient and kind
- Explain the "why," not just the "how"
- Point to docs for further learning
- Welcome follow-up questions

**Example:**
> That error happens when the Nix daemon isn't running. Try `sudo systemctl start nix-daemon`. This daemon manages Nix operations in the background. Here's more info: [link to docs]
