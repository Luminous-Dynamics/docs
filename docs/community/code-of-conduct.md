# Community Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open, welcoming, and consciousness-first environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to a compassionate, dignified, and healthy community where technology serves human flourishing.

## Consciousness-First Principles

Our community is guided by consciousness-first computing principles:

### 1. Respect Attention
- **Be concise**: Value others' time and attention
- **Stay focused**: Keep discussions on-topic and productive
- **Reduce noise**: Quality over quantity in communication

### 2. Amplify Capability
- **Empower others**: Share knowledge generously
- **Support growth**: Welcome questions from all skill levels
- **Enable independence**: Teach people to solve their own problems

### 3. Maintain Transparency
- **Communicate openly**: Share reasoning and decision-making process
- **Acknowledge limitations**: It's okay to say "I don't know"
- **Surface conflicts**: Address issues directly and respectfully

### 4. Enable Sovereignty
- **Respect autonomy**: Everyone makes their own choices
- **Avoid manipulation**: No guilt-tripping, pressure, or coercion
- **Honor boundaries**: Accept "no" gracefully

### 5. Serve Wellbeing
- **Prioritize humans**: Technology serves people, not the reverse
- **Foster belonging**: Create spaces where everyone can participate
- **Support wholeness**: Recognize people as complete beings, not just their code contributions

## Our Standards

### Expected Behavior

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- **Using welcoming and inclusive language**
- **Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences**
- **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism**
- **Focusing on what is best for the community**
- **Showing empathy towards other community members**
- **Giving credit generously** and acknowledging others' contributions
- **Assuming good intent** while remaining open to impact
- **Asking questions** rather than making assumptions
- **Offering help proactively** to those who are struggling
- **Celebrating others' successes** without jealousy

### Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- **Harassment and discrimination** of any kind
- **The use of sexualized language or imagery** and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- **Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments**, and personal or political attacks
- **Public or private harassment**
- **Publishing others' private information** without explicit permission
- **Spam or self-promotion** unrelated to the community
- **Attention manipulation**: Clickbait, manufactured urgency, guilt-tripping
- **Gatekeeping**: "You're not a real [X]" or "Everyone knows [Y]"
- **Condescension**: Making others feel small or stupid for not knowing something
- **Dismissing concerns**: "It's not a big deal" or "You're too sensitive"
- **Other conduct** which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Special Guidance

#### On Technical Disagreements

Technical disagreements are normal and healthy:

- **Focus on ideas, not people**: "This approach might not scale" vs. "You don't understand scaling"
- **Provide reasoning**: Explain *why* you disagree
- **Stay humble**: You might be wrong; they might have context you lack
- **Seek understanding**: "Help me understand your thinking" is more productive than "That's wrong"
- **Agree to disagree**: Not all disagreements need resolution

#### On Helping Beginners

Everyone was a beginner once:

- **Never say "just"**: "Just do X" makes it sound trivial when it's not
- **Avoid RTFM**: If docs answered their question well, they wouldn't ask
- **Provide context**: Don't just give answers, explain the "why"
- **Celebrate questions**: "Great question!" helps more than you think
- **Update docs**: If many people ask the same thing, the docs need improvement

#### On Giving Feedback

Feedback helps us all grow:

- **Be specific**: "The documentation is confusing" → "Section X could use more examples"
- **Be kind**: You can be honest and compassionate simultaneously
- **Suggest alternatives**: Don't just criticize, offer better approaches
- **Review intentions**: Feedback should help, not punish or shame
- **Accept rejection**: Your suggestion might not be implemented, and that's okay

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces, including:

- GitHub repositories (issues, PRs, discussions)
- Discord server
- Community forums
- Email communications
- Events (virtual or in-person)

It also applies when representing the community in public spaces. Examples include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to:

**Email**: conduct@luminousdynamics.org

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter.

- Your account of what occurred, including any relevant context
- Links to public records (GitHub comments, Discord messages, etc.)

### Confidentiality

All reports will be kept confidential to the extent possible. We will only share information:

- With community moderators involved in investigating the report
- When legally required

Reporters will not be retaliated against for good-faith reports.

### Investigation Process

1. **Acknowledgment** within 24 hours of receiving the report
2. **Investigation**: Review evidence, interview involved parties if needed
3. **Decision**: Determine if Code of Conduct was violated
4. **Action**: Implement appropriate consequences (see below)
5. **Follow-up**: Check in with reporter about resolution

### Consequences

Community moderators may take any action they deem appropriate, including:

**Warning**: Private, written warning with clarity about the violation and expected behavior changes.

**Temporary Ban**: Temporary ban from community spaces (GitHub, Discord, etc.). Duration specified based on severity.

**Permanent Ban**: Permanent removal from all community spaces. Reserved for severe or repeated violations.

**Public Statement**: In cases affecting community safety, a public statement may be made (without identifying the reporter).

Appeals will be reviewed by community leaders not involved in the original decision.
