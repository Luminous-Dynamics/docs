## Principles Guiding Our Roadmap

### 1. Consciousness-First Always

Every feature evaluated through lens:
- Does it respect attention?
- Does it amplify capability?
- Does it maintain transparency?
- Does it enable sovereignty?
- Does it serve wellbeing?

**If no, we don't build it.** Even if profitable.

### 2. Community Over Metrics

We optimize for:
- ✅ User sovereignty and capability
- ✅ Community ownership and benefit
- ✅ Long-term sustainability
- ✅ Transparency and trust

Not for:
- ❌ Engagement metrics
- ❌ User lock-in
- ❌ Data collection
- ❌ Maximum extraction

### 3. Open Over Closed

Default to:
- ✅ Open source
- ✅ Open standards
- ✅ Open data (where appropriate)
- ✅ Open governance

Unless strong reason for privacy/security.

### 4. Sustainable Over Hyper-Growth

We target:
- Sustainable revenue
- Reasonable returns (not maximum)
- Long-term viability
- Team wellbeing

Not:
- Unicorn valuations
- Hyper-growth
- Burn rate strategies
- Exit to acquisition

---

## What We're NOT Building

**Important to be clear:**

### Luminous Nix Won't:
- ❌ Collect telemetry without explicit consent
- ❌ Require cloud connection for basic features
- ❌ Gate capabilities behind premium tiers
- ❌ Optimize for engagement over utility
- ❌ Lock you into our ecosystem

### Terra Lumina Won't:
- ❌ Invest in fossil fuels or greenwashing
- ❌ Exit to private equity or corporations
- ❌ Prioritize returns over community benefit
- ❌ Pursue maximum user acquisition
- ❌ Sell user data to third parties

### Both Won't:
- ❌ Sacrifice sovereignty for convenience
- ❌ Add dark patterns or manipulation
- ❌ Compromise on transparency
- ❌ Abandon consciousness-first principles
- ❌ Pursue growth at expense of values

**These are commitments, not preferences.**
