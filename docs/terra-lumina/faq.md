# Frequently Asked Questions

## Investment Basics

### What is Terra Lumina?

Terra Lumina is a renewable energy investment platform that democratizes access to clean energy projects. We enable anyone to invest as little as $10 in local renewable energy infrastructure while creating a path to community ownership through our Regenerative Exit model.

### What is the minimum investment?

**$10** - We believe everyone should have access to renewable energy investment, regardless of wealth. You can invest any amount from $10 to millions per project.

### Is this really investing, or is it a donation?

**This is real investing** with expected financial returns. It's not charity. You own a share of energy projects that generate revenue, and you receive returns based on performance. However, unlike traditional investments, our Regenerative Exit model transitions ownership to communities over time.

### What returns can I expect?

**Target range**: 8-14% IRR (Internal Rate of Return) over 5-7 years.

!!! warning "Important Disclaimers"
    - Returns are **not guaranteed** and depend on project performance
    - Past performance does not indicate future results
    - Energy markets and regulations can change
    - Individual project risks vary significantly
    - You could lose some or all of your investment

Always invest only what you can afford to lose. This is a long-term investment, not a savings account.

### How long until I get my money back?

**Typical timeline:**

- **Quarterly distributions**: Start 3-6 months after project completion
- **Full return of capital**: 5-7 years on average
- **Total investment period**: 7-10 years including community transition

This is a **long-term investment**. If you need liquidity sooner, Terra Lumina may not be suitable for you.

### Can I sell my investment before maturity?

Currently, there is **limited liquidity**. We're working on:

- Secondary marketplace (planned 2026)
- Buyback programs for hardship cases
- Transfer to other investors (with approval)

For now, plan to hold your investment for the full term.

## Returns & Distributions

### How are returns calculated?

- **Capacity payments**: Grid reliability services

Your share is proportional to your investment amount.

**This is complex and varies by jurisdiction:**

**US investors:**

- 1099 forms provided annually
- Consult a tax professional

**EU investors:**

- Tax treatment varies by country
- Some countries offer renewable energy incentives
- Annual tax documentation provided

**We are not tax advisors.** Consult with a qualified tax professional in your jurisdiction.

## Regenerative Exit Model

### What does "Regenerative Exit" mean?

Unlike traditional startups that "exit" by selling to the highest bidder (extracting value from the community), we "exit" by **transferring ownership to the communities** our projects serve.

**Timeline:**

- **Years 0-3**: Traditional investment structure, you receive returns
- **Years 3-5**: Community participation increases, shared governance
- **Years 5-7**: Gradual ownership transfer begins
- **Year 7+**: Full community ownership, you've received your returns

### Will I lose my investment when it transitions to community ownership?

**No!** By the time ownership transitions:

1. You've already received your principal back plus returns
2. The transition happens only after investor obligations are met
3. You may receive community appreciation bonuses
4. You'll have the option to reinvest in new projects

### Why would I want this?

Several reasons:

1. **Financial**: Competitive returns over the investment period
2. **Impact**: Lasting community benefit beyond your investment
3. **Legacy**: Projects continue serving communities for decades
4. **Tax benefits**: Potential charitable deduction for transition value
5. **Values alignment**: Invest in line with your principles

### How does community ownership work?

Projects transition to:

- **Community trusts**: Locally governed, democratically managed
- **Energy cooperatives**: Member-owned and operated
- **Municipal utilities**: City or county ownership

Communities receive training and support for successful transition.

## Platform & Technology

Consult with a financial advisor about whether this fits your retirement strategy.

## Impact & Values

### What is the environmental impact?

Every project displays:

- **Carbon offset**: Tons of CO2 avoided annually
- **Homes powered**: Equivalent households served
- **Energy independence**: Reduction in fossil fuel dependence
- **Grid resilience**: Contribution to energy security

**Example**: $1,000 investment in typical solar project ≈ 10 tons CO2 avoided over project lifetime.

### What about community benefits?

**Direct benefits:**

- Local job creation (construction and operations)
- Reduced energy costs for community
- Tax revenue for local government

**Long-term benefits:**
