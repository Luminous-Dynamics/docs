## Custom Calculator Guide

**Calculate Your Own Scenario:**

### Step 1: Choose Investment Amount

| Amount | Typical Use Case |
|--------|------------------|
| $10 - $100 | Testing, learning, first investment |
| $100 - $1,000 | Regular impact investing, building portfolio |
| $1,000 - $10,000 | Serious impact investor, diversified portfolio |
| $10,000 - $100,000 | Significant commitment, governance participation |
| $100,000+ | Institutional, family office, foundation |

### Step 2: Select Expected IRR

| Project Type | Conservative | Moderate | Strong |
|--------------|--------------|----------|--------|
| **Solar** | 8% | 10% | 12% |
| **Wind** | 9% | 11% | 13% |
| **Hydro** | 10% | 12% | 14% |
| **Mixed Portfolio** | 9% | 11% | 13% |

!!! warning "Important Disclaimers"
    - IRR estimates are targets, not guarantees
    - Actual returns depend on project performance
    - Renewable energy investments carry risks
    - Past performance doesn't guarantee future results
    - Review each project's prospectus carefully

### Step 3: Calculate Returns

**Simple Interest Formula (conservative estimate):**
```
Final Amount = Initial Investment × (1 + IRR)^Years
Total Return = Final Amount - Initial Investment
```

**Quarterly Distribution Estimate:**
```
Quarterly Distribution = (Final Amount / 4) × (IRR / Quarters)
```

### Step 4: Calculate Impact

**Energy Generation (kWh):**
```
Clean Energy = Investment Amount × 7.5 kWh per dollar invested (avg)
```

**CO2 Offset (kg):**
```
CO2 Offset = Clean Energy (kWh) × 0.67 kg CO2/kWh (grid average)
```

**Tree Equivalent:**
```
Trees = CO2 Offset (kg) / 22 kg per tree per year
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How accurate are these estimates?

These are **projections based on typical project performance**, not guarantees. Actual returns depend on:
- Specific project characteristics
- Weather and resource availability
- Equipment performance
- Energy market conditions
- Regulatory environment

Always review each project's prospectus for specific risk factors and projections.

### When do I receive distributions?

**Quarterly distributions** typically begin 6-12 months after project completion:
- Solar: 6-9 months after investment
- Wind: 9-12 months after investment
- Hydro: 12-18 months after investment (retrofit projects)

### What happens if a project underperforms?

Terra Lumina's **diversification approach** means:
1. Your investment is spread across multiple projects
2. One underperforming project has limited impact on overall returns
3. Project managers work to optimize performance
4. Transparent reporting keeps you informed

### Can I withdraw my investment early?

**Liquidity terms vary by project:**
- Most projects: 3-7 year terms
- Secondary market: Sell to other investors (coming Q3 2026)
- Early withdrawal: May incur penalties, check project terms

### How do I maximize returns?

**Best practices:**
1. **Diversify** across project types and geographies
2. **Invest regularly** (dollar-cost averaging)
3. **Reinvest distributions** for compound growth
4. **Choose strong projects** (review track records)
5. **Participate in governance** (aligned incentives)
6. **Hold for full term** (avoid early withdrawal penalties)
