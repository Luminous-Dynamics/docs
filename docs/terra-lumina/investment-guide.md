- Exit planning and transitions

## Investment Philosophy

### Regenerative Investing

Terra Lumina investments are **fundamentally different** from traditional investing:

**Traditional:**
```
Invest → Extract maximum return → Exit → Move on
Community left with corporate owner
```

**Regenerative:**
```
Invest → Earn competitive return → Transfer to community → Lasting benefit
Community owns asset forever
```

**This changes everything:**

- **Time horizon**: 7-10 years, not 3-5
- **Success metric**: Community benefit + returns, not just IRR
- **Exit**: Transfer to community, not sell to highest bidder
- **Values**: Aligned with wellbeing, not extraction

### Investment Criteria

Before investing in any project, ask:

1. **Financial**: Can this generate 8-14% IRR?
2. **Impact**: Does this benefit the local community?
3. **Regenerative**: Is there a path to community ownership?
4. **Risk**: Can I afford to lose this investment?
5. **Values**: Does this align with my principles?

All five should be "yes" for Terra Lumina projects.

## Portfolio Construction

### Diversification Strategies

#### Geographic Diversification

**Don't concentrate in one region:**

```
✅ Good:
- $200 California solar
- $200 Texas wind
- $200 Oregon hydro
- $200 New York storage
- $200 Arizona solar

❌ Bad:
- $1,000 all in California projects
```

**Why:** Regional risks (weather, regulations, grid issues) are correlated.

**Target:** No more than 30% in any single state/region.

#### Technology Diversification

**Balance across energy types:**

**Recommended allocation:**

- **40% Solar** - Proven, scalable, decreasing costs
- **25% Wind** - Geographic diversity, night generation
- **20% Hydro** - Baseload, very reliable, long lifespan
- **10% Storage** - Future-focused, grid stabilization
- **5% Nuclear (SMR)** - High risk/return, when available

**Why each:**

**Solar:**
- Most projects available
- Well understood technology
- Decreasing costs (better returns)
- Works in many locations

**Wind:**
- Different weather patterns than solar
- Generates at night
- Great in specific locations
- Complements solar

**Hydro:**
- Most reliable (24/7 baseload)
- Long lifespan (50+ years)
- Proven technology
- Limited availability (best sites taken)

**Storage:**
- Critical for grid future
- High growth potential
- Less proven at scale
- Higher risk, potentially higher return

**Nuclear SMR:**
- Emerging technology
- High capacity factor
- Long-term baseload
- Highest risk, potentially highest return

#### Risk-Level Diversification

**Balance risk across portfolio:**

**Conservative allocation (lower risk, lower return):**
- 60% Five-star projects (very low risk)
- 30% Four-star projects (low risk)
- 10% Three-star projects (moderate risk)

**Balanced allocation:**
- 40% Five-star
- 40% Four-star
- 15% Three-star
- 5% Two-star

**Aggressive allocation (higher risk, higher return):**
- 20% Five-star
- 30% Four-star
- 30% Three-star
- 15% Two-star
- 5% One-star (emerging tech)

**Most investors should use Balanced.**

#### Stage Diversification

**Mix operating and under-construction:**

- **60% Operating** - Already generating revenue, lower risk
- **30% Under Construction** - Higher risk, potentially better returns
- **10% Planning Stage** - Highest risk, earliest entry point

**Why:** Operating projects provide steady distributions while construction projects offer growth.

### Portfolio Size

#### Minimum for Diversification

**$500-1,000 across 5-10 projects**

Example $1,000 portfolio:
- 5 projects × $200 each
- Mix of tech types and locations
- Mix of risk levels (mostly 4-5 star)

**Why:** True diversification needs multiple projects.

#### Scaling Your Portfolio

**Year 1: Learn**
- Start with $500-1,000
- 5-10 projects at $100-200 each
- Focus on understanding platform and returns

**Year 2: Grow**
- Add $2,000-5,000 based on Year 1 experience
- Increase position sizes in successful projects
- Add new project types

**Year 3+: Mature**
- Regular contributions ($200-500/month)
- Rebalance as needed
- Take advantage of new opportunities

### Due Diligence Checklist

Before investing, verify:

- [ ] Read complete project documentation
- [ ] Reviewed financial projections and assumptions
- [ ] Understand the revenue model
- [ ] Checked developer track record
- [ ] Confirmed all permits obtained
- [ ] Reviewed grid connection agreement
- [ ] Assessed community support
- [ ] Understood risk factors
- [ ] Comfortable with risk level
- [ ] Know exit timeline (7-10 years)
- [ ] Can afford to lose this investment
- [ ] Values aligned with project approach

**If any checkbox is unchecked and concerning, don't invest.**

## Risk Management

### Understanding Risk

**All investments carry risk of loss.**

Terra Lumina projects can fail or underperform due to:

- Construction delays or cost overruns
- Lower than expected energy production
- Equipment failures
- Regulatory changes
- Market price decreases
- Natural disasters
- Operator failure
- Grid issues

**You could lose some or all of your investment.**

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

#### 1. Diversification (Primary Strategy)

**Don't put all eggs in one basket:**

- Invest in 5-10+ projects minimum
- Spread across technologies
- Spread across geographies
- Spread across risk levels
- Spread across project stages

**Math:** If one $200 investment fails (100% loss) in a $2,000 portfolio, you lose 10% overall, not 100%.

#### 2. Position Sizing

**Never invest more than you can afford to lose:**

- Single project: Max 10-15% of portfolio
- Single technology: Max 40% of portfolio
- Single region: Max 30% of portfolio
- Single risk level: Consider limits

**Example:** $10,000 portfolio should have no more than $1,000-1,500 in any single project.

#### 3. Risk-Adjusted Returns

**Higher risk should = higher expected return:**

- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Five-star: 8-10% IRR (lowest risk)
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Four-star: 10-12% IRR
- ⭐⭐⭐ Three-star: 11-13% IRR
- ⭐⭐ Two-star: 13-15% IRR
- ⭐ One-star: 15%+ IRR (highest risk)

**If a five-star project offers 15% IRR, be skeptical—what's the catch?**

#### 4. Staged Entry

**Don't invest all at once:**

```
Month 1: $500 in 5 projects ($100 each)
Month 3: $500 more if Month 1 going well
Month 6: $1,000 more, increase positions
Month 12: $2,000 more, full portfolio
```

**Why:** Learn as you go, adjust strategy based on experience.

#### 5. Emergency Reserve

**Don't invest emergency funds:**

- Keep 3-6 months expenses in savings
- Only invest money you won't need for 7-10 years
- Terra Lumina investments are illiquid
- No easy exit if you need cash

### Monitoring and Red Flags

**Monitor projects quarterly:**

- Actual vs. projected energy production
- Actual vs. projected distributions
- Project updates and communications
- Any delays or issues

**Red flags requiring action:**

🚩 **No distributions for 2+ quarters** (operating projects)
→ Contact Terra Lumina, investigate

🚩 **Energy production <80% of projections** (consistently)
→ Investigate cause, consider implications

🚩 **Major construction delays** (6+ months)
→ Reassess timeline and risk

🚩 **Operator changes** or **management turnover**
→ Investigate stability

🚩 **Community opposition emerges**
→ Consider implications for transition

**If red flags persist, consider:** Holding vs. selling on secondary market (when available).

## Tax Optimization

### Tax Treatment (US)

**Consult a tax professional—this is general info only.**

#### Distribution Income

**Quarterly distributions are generally:**

- Taxed as ordinary income
- Reported on 1099-DIV or 1099-MISC
- Taxed at your marginal rate

**Example:** $1,000 investment generating $110/year (11% return) at 24% tax rate = $26.40 tax, $83.60 after-tax = 8.36% after-tax return.

#### Depreciation Benefits

**Some energy projects offer depreciation:**

- Accelerated depreciation (MACRS)
- Can offset distribution income
- Reduces taxable income
- Consult with tax advisor

#### Tax Credits

**Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC):**

- 30% for solar (through 2032)
- Pass-through to investors possible
- Can significantly boost after-tax returns
- Project-specific, not all qualify

**Production Tax Credit (PTC):**

- For wind projects
- $0.027/kWh (adjusted for inflation)
- First 10 years of operation
- Pass-through possible

**Check if project passes through credits to investors.**

#### Long-Term Capital Gains

**When ownership transfers to community:**

- May qualify as charitable donation
- Potential tax deduction
- Based on fair market value at transfer
- Consult tax advisor

#### Tax-Advantaged Accounts

**Self-directed IRA/401(k):**

- Can invest in Terra Lumina projects
- Tax-deferred growth
- No immediate tax on distributions
- Requires self-directed account administrator
- May have higher fees

**Benefits:**
- Tax-deferred or tax-free growth (Roth)
- No quarterly tax on distributions
- Larger compounding effect

**Considerations:**
- Setup complexity
- Administrator fees
- RMD implications (traditional IRA)

### International Tax

**For non-US investors:**

- Tax treatment varies by country
- May be subject to US withholding tax
- Double taxation treaties may apply
- Consult local tax advisor

**Terra Lumina provides:**
- Annual tax documentation
- US tax reporting (as required)
- Assistance connecting to tax advisors

## Rebalancing & Maintenance

### When to Rebalance

**Review portfolio quarterly:**

Check if allocations drifted from targets:

**Example drift:**

Target: 40% solar, 25% wind, 20% hydro, 10% storage, 5% nuclear

Actual after 1 year: 50% solar (grew), 20% wind, 18% hydro, 10% storage, 2% nuclear

**Action:** Rebalance by investing new funds in under-weight categories (wind, hydro, nuclear).

### Rebalancing Strategies

#### 1. New Money Rebalancing

**Add new investments to under-weight categories:**

- No selling required
- No tax implications
- Gradual rebalancing
- Most common approach

#### 2. Distribution Reinvestment

**Reinvest distributions in under-weight categories:**

- Compounds growth
- Maintains diversification
- Tax on distributions still owed

#### 3. Selling and Redeploying

**Once secondary market available:**

- Sell over-weight positions
- Buy under-weight positions
- Faster rebalancing
- Tax implications on gains

**Currently:** Secondary market not available, use new money method.

### Adding to Existing Positions

**When to increase position size:**

- Project performing above expectations
- Still under position size limit (10-15% max)
- Want to double down on winners
- New financing rounds available

**Process:**
1. Review updated project info
2. Confirm still aligned with strategy
3. Ensure not over-concentrating
4. Add investment

## Advanced Strategies

### Dollar-Cost Averaging

**Regular investments over time:**

```
$500/month for 24 months = $12,000 portfolio
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces timing risk
- Builds discipline
- Averages into different project vintages
- Smoother entry

**Best for:** Regular savers, volatile markets

### Barbell Strategy

**Combine very safe + very risky:**

- 70% in five-star projects (very safe)
- 30% in one-two-star projects (very risky)

**vs. Balanced:**
- 100% in three-four-star projects (moderate risk)

**Barbell benefits:**
- Protected downside (safe assets)
- Upside exposure (risky assets)
- May outperform balanced

**Barbell risks:**
- Risky assets could fail completely
- Requires discipline to maintain

### Geographic Concentration (Intentional)

**Contrary to diversification advice:**

**Strategy:** Concentrate in region you know/care about

**Benefits:**
- Personal connection to projects
- Better evaluation ability (local knowledge)
- Can visit projects
- Direct community impact

**Risks:**
- Regional concentration risk
- All projects affected by regional issues

**When this makes sense:**
- Strong regional preference
- Deep local knowledge
- Willing to accept higher risk
- Values impact over returns

### Early-Stage Concentration

**Invest only in planning/construction stage:**

**Theory:** Highest returns come from earliest entry

**Benefits:**
- Lower valuations (higher returns)
- Ground floor opportunity
- Larger potential upside

**Risks:**
- Higher failure rate
- Longer wait for distributions
- More things can go wrong
- Requires more capital (less diversification)

**Only for:** Risk-tolerant investors, larger portfolios

## Exit Planning

### Understanding the Timeline

**Typical project lifecycle:**

- Years 0-2: Construction and ramp-up
- Years 2-5: Full operations, steady distributions
- Years 5-7: Transition preparation
- Year 7+: Community ownership

**Your exit:** Year 7-10 typically

### Transition to Community Ownership

**How it works:**

1. **Year 5-7:** Investor obligations fully met (returns paid)
2. **Community entity formed:** Trust, co-op, or municipal utility
3. **Skills transferred:** Training and knowledge sharing
4. **Ownership transferred:** Legal transfer to community
5. **You exit:** No longer owner, community owns

**What you get:**
- All principal and returns received (by year 7)
- Potential appreciation bonus
- Possible tax deduction for charitable transfer
- Impact legacy

**What you don't get:**
- Ongoing distributions after transfer
- Asset ownership
- Control rights

**This is the model.** If you want perpetual ownership, Terra Lumina isn't right fit.

### Secondary Market (Future)

**Planned for 2026:**

- Sell investments before maturity
- Buy others' positions
- Price discovery via marketplace
- Liquidity for emergencies

**How it will work:**
- List position for sale
- Other investors bid
- Price negotiated (may be discount to NAV)
- Transfer of ownership

**When to use:**
- Emergency need for cash
- Want to exit early
- Rebalancing portfolio
- Lost confidence in project

**Costs:**
- Transaction fee (~2-3%)
- Potential discount to NAV
- Capital gains tax (if profit)

### Planning Your Exit

**Year 5 review:**

For each investment:
- [ ] Has project met financial targets?
- [ ] Is community transition on track?
- [ ] Are you comfortable with timeline?
- [ ] Do you want to hold to maturity?
- [ ] Or sell on secondary market?

**Year 7 planning:**

- Understand tax implications of transfer
- Consult tax advisor
- Plan for reinvestment if desired
- Celebrate impact achieved!
