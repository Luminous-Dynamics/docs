## vs. ESG/Impact Funds

### vs. ESG Index Funds

**Terra Lumina advantages:**

✅ **Impact transparency** - See exactly what you fund
✅ **Direct ownership** - You own the solar farm
✅ **Verified impact** - Measurable kWh, CO₂ avoided
✅ **No greenwashing** - Physical assets, not stocks
✅ **Community benefit** - Regenerative exit to local ownership
✅ **Lower fees** - 1% platform fee vs 0.5-2% fund fees

**ESG fund advantages:**

✅ **Diversification** - Hundreds of companies
✅ **Liquidity** - Trade daily
✅ **Professional screening** - Experts filter ESG criteria
✅ **Lower minimum** - $1 via fractional shares
✅ **Passive** - No individual due diligence needed
✅ **Tax-advantaged** - Can hold in IRA/401(k)

**Impact comparison:**

**ESG Fund (example - VFTAX Vanguard FTSE Social Index):**
- Holdings: 400+ companies screened for ESG
- Impact: Indirect (excludes bad actors)
- Verification: ESG scores (subjective)
- Outcome: Shareholder value maximization
- Community benefit: None (traditional exits)

**Terra Lumina:**
- Holdings: Specific projects you choose
- Impact: Direct (you fund solar farm)
- Verification: kWh generated, CO₂ avoided (measurable)
- Outcome: Returns to you, then community ownership
- Community benefit: Permanent local ownership

**The greenwashing problem:**

Many ESG funds hold:
- Oil companies ("working on clean energy")
- Banks funding fossil fuels ("improving")
- Companies with poor labor practices ("better than others")

**Terra Lumina:**
- 100% renewable energy
- No fossil fuel funding
- Direct community benefit
- Transparent project details

**Who should choose ESG funds:**
- Want broad diversification
- Need daily liquidity
- Prefer passive investing
- Trust ESG screening methodologies
- Can't commit to 10-year hold

**Who should choose Terra Lumina:**
- Want verifiable direct impact
- Skeptical of ESG claims
- Can commit capital for 10 years
- Want to choose specific projects
- Value community ownership outcome

### vs. Impact Investing Platforms (Swell, OpenInvest, etc.)

**Terra Lumina advantages:**

✅ **Direct asset ownership** - You own infrastructure
✅ **Regenerative exit** - Community ownership transfer
✅ **Higher impact transparency** - Specific project metrics
✅ **Uncorrelated** - Not stock market dependent

**Other platforms advantages:**

✅ **Liquidity** - Stocks can be sold
✅ **Diversification** - Multiple companies/sectors
✅ **Lower minimums** - Often $1 minimum
✅ **Passive management** - Automated rebalancing
✅ **IRA compatible** - Retirement account access

**Key difference:**

Most impact platforms invest in **stocks of impact companies**.
Terra Lumina offers **direct ownership of physical infrastructure**.

**Example:**

**Swell Impact Portfolio:**
- Invests in stocks of Tesla, Vestas, NextEra
- Impact is indirect (support these companies)
- You don't own the solar farms, you own stock
- Exit is selling stock (to another investor)

**Terra Lumina:**
- You own piece of specific solar farm
- Impact is direct (your capital built it)
- You own the actual asset
- Exit is transfer to community (regenerative)

Both valid. Different models.
