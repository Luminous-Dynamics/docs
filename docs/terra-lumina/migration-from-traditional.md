# Migration Guide: From Traditional Investing to Terra Lumina

**Help for investors transitioning from stocks, bonds, and traditional impact investing.**

---

## Overview

Terra Lumina represents a different approach to investing—one where returns come with community benefit, and exits build wealth locally instead of extracting it. This guide helps traditional investors understand the transition.

**Who this is for:**
- Stock market investors
- Bond and fixed-income investors
- REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) investors
- Impact investing platform users
- Retirement account holders
- Anyone with investment experience

**What you'll learn:**
- How Terra Lumina compares to traditional investments
- Translation of familiar concepts
- Portfolio integration strategies
- Tax and account considerations
- Risk assessment differences

## Quick Concept Mapping

### Investment Philosophy

**Traditional investing:**
```
Capital → Company/Asset → Growth → Exit to highest bidder → Extract maximum value
```

**Terra Lumina (Regenerative Investing):**
```
Capital → Community Project → Returns → Community ownership → Local benefit perpetuates
```

**Key differences:**

| Aspect | Traditional | Terra Lumina |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Exit** | Sell to highest bidder | Transfer to community |
| **Timeline** | Indefinite/unknown | 10 years (defined) |
| **Returns** | Variable, market-driven | Expected 7-13%, project-specific |
| **Liquidity** | Trade anytime | 10-year hold (limited early exit) |
| **Impact** | Indirect (ESG funds) | Direct (specific projects) |
| **Control** | Shareholder voting | Community governance transition |
| **Risk profile** | Market risk | Project/operational risk |

## Investment Type Translations

### From Stocks to Terra Lumina

**What you're used to (S&P 500 index):**
- Average 10% annual return (historical)
- High liquidity (sell anytime)
- Market volatility (can lose value)
- Dividend payments (some stocks)
- Exit: Sell shares on market

**Terra Lumina equivalent:**
- Expected 7-13% annual returns (project-specific)
- Low liquidity (10-year hold period)
- Stable value (not traded, no volatility)
- Quarterly/annual distributions
- Exit: Ownership transfers to community

**Why switch (or diversify)?**
- ✅ Predictable timeline (10 years vs unknown)
- ✅ Direct impact (see exactly what you fund)
- ✅ Community benefit (wealth stays local)
- ✅ No market volatility stress
- ❌ Lower liquidity (can't sell early without hardship)
- ❌ Slightly lower returns (7-13% vs 10% market average)

**Best for:**
- Investors who can commit capital for 10 years
- Those wanting direct renewable energy exposure
- Impact-focused investors
- Diversification from stock market correlation

### From Bonds to Terra Lumina

**What you're used to (Corporate/Municipal bonds):**
- Fixed interest payments
- Return of principal at maturity
- Low risk (relative to stocks)

- Return of capital at year 10
- Project-specific risk (see [Five Pillars](investment-guide.md#five-pillar-evaluation-framework))
- Predictable projected income
- No interest rate risk (not debt instrument)

**Why switch (or diversify)?**
- ✅ Higher returns (7-13% vs 2-5% bonds)

## Migration Strategies

### Strategy 1: Gradual Allocation (Conservative)

**Best for:** Risk-averse investors, first-time impact investors

**Approach:**
```
Year 1: Allocate 2-5% of portfolio to Terra Lumina
        Start small ($100-500), learn the platform
        Monitor performance for 12 months

Year 2: Increase to 5-10% if comfortable
        Diversify across 3-5 projects
        Understand distribution cycles

Year 3+: Reach target allocation (10-20% for impact-focused)
         Mature understanding of risk/return
         Established project preferences
```

**Timeline:** 2-3 years to target allocation

**Example - $100K portfolio:**
- Year 1: $2,000 in Terra Lumina (2%)
- Year 2: $7,000 total (5% - add $5K)
- Year 3: $15,000 total (15% - add $8K)

**Pros:**
- Low risk of over-allocation
- Time to learn and adjust
- Can maintain liquidity elsewhere

**Cons:**
- Slower impact building
- Takes time to see full benefits

### Strategy 2: Direct Replacement (Moderate)

**Best for:** Experienced investors, those with clear allocation targets

**Approach:**
1. **Identify replacement portion** of portfolio
   - Example: Replace 10% bond allocation with Terra Lumina
2. **Sell equivalent traditional holdings**
   - Sell bonds over 6-12 months
3. **Invest proceeds in Terra Lumina**
   - Diversify across 5-10 projects
4. **Maintain allocation balance**
   - Rebalance annually

**Timeline:** 6-12 months

**Example - $250K portfolio with 30% bonds:**
- Current: $75K in bonds
- Goal: $37.5K in bonds, $37.5K in Terra Lumina (split)
- Action: Sell $37.5K bonds, invest in Terra Lumina over 6 months

**Pros:**
- Maintains overall portfolio risk profile
- Clear allocation framework
- Faster impact deployment

**Cons:**
- Taxable event (selling existing holdings)
- Reduced liquidity in that allocation
- Requires selling during migration

### Strategy 3: New Capital Allocation (Aggressive)

**Best for:** Active earners, those with new capital to deploy

**Approach:**
1. **Redirect new investment capital** to Terra Lumina
2. **Don't sell existing holdings** (avoid taxes)
3. **Build allocation over time** with fresh capital
4. **Eventually rebalance** if needed

**Timeline:** Ongoing

**Example - Annual $20K investment capacity:**
- Year 1: 100% of new capital → Terra Lumina ($20K)
- Year 2: 50% Terra Lumina, 50% traditional ($10K each)
- Year 3+: Target split (e.g., 20% Terra Lumina, 80% traditional)

**Pros:**
- No need to sell existing holdings
- Tax-efficient
- Flexible pacing

**Cons:**
- Slower to target allocation
- Requires ongoing new capital
- May create imbalanced portfolio short-term

### Strategy 4: Dedicated Impact Allocation (Focused)

**Best for:** Committed impact investors, those with separate impact goals

**Approach:**
1. **Create separate "impact bucket"** in portfolio
2. **Fund with 5-25% of total portfolio**
3. **Allocate 100% of impact bucket** to Terra Lumina
4. **Manage separately** from traditional holdings

**Timeline:** 1-2 months to establish

**Example - $500K portfolio, 20% impact allocation:**
- Total portfolio: $500K
- Impact allocation: $100K (20%)
- Terra Lumina allocation: $100K (all of impact bucket)
- Traditional allocation: $400K (remaining 80%)

**Pros:**
- Clear impact/traditional separation
- Easy to track impact performance
- Doesn't complicate traditional allocation

**Cons:**
- Requires sufficient capital for diversity
- May concentrate risk in impact bucket
- Separate mental accounting needed

## Portfolio Integration Examples

### Conservative Investor (Age 60, $400K portfolio)

**Current allocation:**
- 40% stocks ($160K)
- 50% bonds ($200K)
- 10% cash ($40K)

**Integrated with Terra Lumina:**
- 35% stocks ($140K) - slight reduction
- 35% bonds ($140K) - reduce fixed income
- 20% Terra Lumina ($80K) - add impact fixed-income replacement
- 10% cash ($40K) - maintain

**Rationale:**
- Replace some bonds with higher-yielding Terra Lumina
- Maintain conservative risk profile
- Fixed 10-year timeline matches retirement planning
- Distributions supplement retirement income

**Terra Lumina portfolio ($80K):**
- $32K in operating solar/hydro projects (low risk, stable)
- $24K in construction projects (medium risk)
- $16K in planning stage (higher risk/return)
- $8K emergency reserve (redeemable if needed)

### Moderate Investor (Age 40, $200K portfolio)

**Current allocation:**
- 70% stocks ($140K)
- 20% bonds ($40K)
- 10% alternative (REITs, commodities) ($20K)

**Integrated with Terra Lumina:**
- 65% stocks ($130K) - maintain growth focus
- 10% bonds ($20K) - reduce some fixed income
- 15% Terra Lumina ($30K) - impact allocation
- 10% other alternatives ($20K) - maintain diversification

**Rationale:**
- Replace half of bonds with Terra Lumina
- Adds uncorrelated alternative asset
- 10-year timeline reasonable at age 40
- Impact focus without sacrificing growth

**Terra Lumina portfolio ($30K):**
- $12K in 4-6 projects (diversification)
- Mix of technologies (solar, wind, hydro)
- Geographic spread (US, Europe, emerging markets)
- Balanced risk across project stages

### Aggressive Investor (Age 30, $75K portfolio)

**Current allocation:**
- 90% stocks ($67.5K)
- 10% cash ($7.5K)

**Integrated with Terra Lumina:**
- 80% stocks ($60K) - maintain growth focus
- 10% Terra Lumina ($7.5K) - start impact exposure
- 10% cash ($7.5K) - maintain emergency fund

**Rationale:**
- Start small with Terra Lumina (learning)
- Long time horizon supports illiquidity
- Can increase allocation over time
- Impact experience early in career

**Terra Lumina portfolio ($7.5K):**
- $7.5K spread across 3-5 smaller projects
- Focus on learning platform
- Plan to add $5-10K annually
- Build to 15-20% allocation over 5 years

## Account and Tax Considerations

### Account Types

**Where you CAN invest in Terra Lumina:**
- ✅ Individual taxable accounts
- ✅ Joint accounts
- ✅ Trust accounts
- ✅ Self-directed IRAs (special setup required)
- ✅ Business/entity accounts

**Where you currently CANNOT:**
- ❌ Standard IRA/401(k) (coming Q3 2026)
- ❌ 529 education savings
- ❌ HSA accounts

**Coming in 2026:**
- Self-directed IRA integration
- Potential 401(k) access (depends on provider)

### Tax Implications

**Distribution income:**
- Taxed as ordinary income (like REIT distributions)
- Reported on Form 1099-DIV
- Subject to federal and state income tax
- NOT qualified dividends (different tax treatment)

**Return of capital:**
- May be partially tax-deferred
- Reduces cost basis
- Taxed at exit if cost basis reaches zero
- Reported on 1099-DIV

**Exit/redemption:**
- Potential capital gain/loss depending on structure
- Long-term capital gains treatment (held > 1 year)
- Transfer to community is not taxable to investor

**Compared to traditional investments:**

| Investment | Tax Treatment | Terra Lumina |
|------------|---------------|--------------|
| Stock dividends | Qualified (0-20% rate) | Ordinary income (10-37%) |
| Bond interest | Ordinary income | Ordinary income |
| REIT distributions | Ordinary income | Ordinary income (similar) |
| Stock sale gains | Cap gains (0-20%) | Cap gains (0-20%) |

**Tax efficiency tips:**
- Hold in taxable accounts if in low tax bracket
- Consider self-directed Roth IRA (tax-free growth)
- Time distributions with lower-income years if possible
- Consult tax advisor for your situation

### Transferring Existing Accounts

**Can I transfer stocks/bonds into Terra Lumina?**
No. You must:
1. Sell existing holdings
2. Transfer cash
3. Invest in Terra Lumina projects

**This creates taxable events** (selling existing holdings).

**Tax-efficient transfer strategy:**
1. Sell in tranches over 12-24 months
2. Harvest losses to offset gains
3. Time sales during lower-income years
4. Prioritize highest-cost-basis holdings first (lower tax)

**Alternative:** Use new capital instead of selling (Strategy 3 above).

## Risk Assessment Translation

### Understanding Different Risk Types

**Stock market risks you know:**
- Market volatility
- Company performance
- Economic cycles
- Sector risks
- Geopolitical events

**Terra Lumina risks (different):**
- Project completion risk (construction delays)
- Technology/equipment risk (performance below expected)
- Regulatory risk (policy changes)
- Counterparty risk (off-taker credit)
- Natural disaster risk (weather events)

**Key difference:**
- Stocks: Correlated to market sentiment and macroeconomics
- Terra Lumina: Tied to specific project execution and energy demand

**This means:**
- ✅ Diversification benefit (uncorrelated returns)
- ✅ Not affected by stock market crashes
- ⚠️ New risk types to understand
- ⚠️ Requires different due diligence

### Using the Five Pillars for Due Diligence

Instead of reading 10-Ks and analyst reports, you evaluate:

**1. Financial Pillar:**
- Revenue projections realistic?
- Third-party validation of returns?
- Conservative assumptions?

**2. Technical Pillar:**
- Proven technology (not experimental)?
- Reputable equipment suppliers?
- Technical due diligence completed?

**3. Community Pillar:**
- Local support for project?
- Job creation plans?
- Community transition plan?

**4. Risk Pillar:**
- Identified and disclosed risks?
- Mitigation strategies in place?
- Insurance coverage adequate?

**5. Values Pillar:**
- Transparent reporting?
- Community ownership commitment?
- Environmental impact positive?

**See:** [Investment Guide - Five Pillars](investment-guide.md#five-pillar-evaluation-framework)

## Common Migration Questions

### "How do I diversify with only $500?"

**Strategy:**
- Start with $100-200 per project
- Invest in 3-5 different projects
- Different technologies (solar, wind)
- Different geographies (US, international)
- Different stages (operating, construction)

**Example $500 allocation:**
- $150 in operating US solar (low risk)
- $150 in construction EU wind (medium risk)
- $100 in planning Peru hydro (higher risk, emerging market)
- $100 in storage project (technology diversity)

**Better:** Save to $1,000+ for more meaningful diversity.

### "What if I need the money before 10 years?"

**Options:**
1. **Hardship redemption** (serious financial need)
   - Medical emergencies
   - Job loss
   - Unexpected expenses
   - Approved on case-by-case basis
   - Redeemed at fair value

2. **Transfer to family/friends**
   - Can transfer ownership
   - Buyer takes on remaining term
   - Subject to KYC/AML
   - No markup allowed

3. **Secondary market** (coming Q2 2026)
   - Pilot program for early exit
   - May trade at discount to fair value
   - Limited liquidity

**Planning tip:** Only invest capital you can commit for 10 years.

### "How do I monitor performance compared to my stock portfolio?"

**Tracking methods:**

1. **Terra Lumina dashboard**
   - Login to see all projects
   - Portfolio performance overview
   - Distribution history
   - Impact metrics (CO₂ avoided, energy generated)

2. **Comparison to stock benchmark**
   - Track annual returns vs S&P 500
   - Terra Lumina: Sum of distributions + asset value change
   - Stocks: Price appreciation + dividends
   - Note: Different risk profiles (not apples-to-apples)

3. **Portfolio trackers**
   - Manually add Terra Lumina holdings
   - Many tools support "other assets"
   - Examples: Personal Capital, Mint, spreadsheet

**Expectation setting:**
- Terra Lumina: Steady 7-13% annual distributions
- Stocks: Variable returns (some years up 20%, others down 15%)
- Don't get discouraged by stock market boom years
- Focus on long-term stability and impact

### "Can I invest through my financial advisor?"

**Currently:**
Most advisors cannot directly transact Terra Lumina (not on traditional platforms).

**You can:**
1. Self-direct Terra Lumina portion
2. Inform advisor for overall portfolio planning
3. Advisor tracks as "alternative investment"

**Coming 2026:**
- Advisor portal for managed accounts
- Integration with some RIA platforms
- Potential 401(k) access through employers

**For now:**
- Invest directly through terralumina.org
- Share performance data with advisor
- Include in overall financial plan

### "How does this compare to buying stocks of renewable energy companies?"

**Buying NEE (NextEra Energy) stock:**
- ✅ High liquidity (trade anytime)
- ✅ Diversified energy portfolio
- ✅ Professional management
- ❌ Shareholder value focus (not community)
- ❌ Traditional exit (no community ownership)
- ❌ Indirect impact (profits to shareholders)

**Investing in Terra Lumina:**
- ❌ Low liquidity (10-year hold)
- ⚠️ Self-directed (you choose projects)
- ✅ Direct ownership of specific assets
- ✅ Community ownership exit
- ✅ Direct impact (you fund specific project)
- ✅ Returns + impact (aligned)

**Use case differences:**
- Stocks: For liquidity needs, diversification, passive investing
- Terra Lumina: For impact, long-term holds, direct ownership

**Many investors do both:** 70-80% traditional + 20-30% Terra Lumina.

**Migration:**
- Allocated 15% ($90K) to Terra Lumina over 18 months
- Sold bonds gradually to fund
- Reduced portfolio volatility while adding impact

**Result:**
> "I replaced my lowest-yielding bonds with Terra Lumina. Same risk profile, better returns, and I'm funding projects I believe in. Plus, knowing it goes to the community after 10 years feels right."

- Moved 20% from ESG funds to Terra Lumina
- Direct project selection over fund screening
- Better impact transparency

**Result:**

**Allocation:**
- 60% total stock market (was 50%)
- 20% Terra Lumina (was 0%)
- 10% ESG funds (was 30%)
- 10% bonds (was 20%)
