### FAQs Tab

**Project-specific Q&A:**

**Q: What happens if solar production is lower than expected?**

A: The project has performance insurance that guarantees 90% of projected energy production. If actual production falls below this, insurance covers the shortfall. Additionally, our projections use conservative assumptions (P90 confidence level), meaning there's a 90% probability that actual production will *exceed* projections.

**Q: What if the utility doesn't pay for the electricity?**

A: The Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) is with Nevada Energy, an A-rated utility backed by Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Additionally, the PPA includes payment security provisions and is backed by a letter of credit. Risk of non-payment is extremely low.

**Q: How will I receive returns?**

A: Quarterly distributions are deposited directly to your Terra Lumina account. You can withdraw to your bank account, reinvest in other projects, or accumulate for the exit.

**Q: Can I visit the project?**

A: Yes! We offer quarterly site tours for investors. Sign up through your account dashboard. Virtual tours are available anytime through the project page.
