- **Locations:** Different regions and grids
- **Risk levels:** Mix of 3-5 star projects
- **Project stages:** Some operating, some under construction
- **Timelines:** Varying ownership transition dates

**Example diversified portfolio ($1,000):**

- $200: Solar farm in California (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐) - Operating
- $200: Hydro retrofit in Oregon (⭐⭐⭐⭐) - Construction
- $200: Wind farm in Texas (⭐⭐⭐⭐) - Operating
- $200: Storage in New York (⭐⭐⭐) - Planning
- $200: Solar in Arizona (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐) - Operating

### Investment Pacing

**Recommendation:** Invest gradually, not all at once.

**Month 1:** $100 in first project (learn the process)
**Month 2:** $200 across 2 more projects (gain confidence)
**Month 3:** $300 across 3 more projects (build portfolio)
**Ongoing:** Regular investments as projects launch

**Benefits:**

- Learn from experience
- Reduce timing risk
- See actual performance before investing more
- Build conviction through results

### Monitoring & Rebalancing

**Quarterly review:**

1. Check each project's performance
2. Review distribution amounts
3. Assess risk levels
4. Add to successful projects or types
5. Adjust strategy based on learnings

## Understanding Returns

### What to Expect

**Target IRR:** 8-14% annually

**Reality:** Actual returns vary by project

**Example timeline for $100 investment at 11% IRR:**

| Year | Distribution | Cumulative | Project Status |
|------|--------------|------------|----------------|
| 1 | $11 | $11 | Construction/Ramp up |
| 2 | $11 | $22 | Full operations |
| 3 | $11 | $33 | Stable operations |
| 4 | $11 | $44 | Stable operations |
| 5 | $11 | $55 | Preparing transition |
| 6 | $11 | $66 | Transition begins |
| 7 | $11 | $77 | Community ownership |

**By year 7:** You've received $77 on $100 investment (77% return), project transfers to community.

**After year 7:** Project continues serving community, owned locally.

### Risks & Realities

**What could reduce returns:**

- Less energy production than projected (weather, equipment)
- Higher operating costs than expected
- Regulatory changes affecting revenue
- Equipment failures requiring repairs
- Grid connection delays

**What could increase returns:**

- Better than expected production
- Lower operating costs
- Electricity price increases
- Additional revenue streams (carbon credits, grid services)

**Important:** This is real investing with real risks. Some projects may underperform or fail. Diversification helps manage this risk.
